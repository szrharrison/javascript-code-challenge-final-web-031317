# JavaScript Code Challenge

## Objectives

+ Constructors / Prototypes or ES6 Classes
+ Callbacks
+ DOM Manipulation
+ Events and Event Handlers

## Instructions

Today we're going to build out an image-sharing application called "Instantgram". Users will provide an image URL and a caption in a form. When the form is submitted, we should append that image into the DOM.

Instant-gram is anti-persistence, so we won't be making any requests to a backend. Each time we refresh, all the photos will disappear.

## Deliverables

Build out the feature so that it functions in accordance with the gif above. Don't worry about the CSS/styling - just get the basic functionality working.

Do your best to follow best practices/separation of concerns. Can you use separate classes? Make a model? Above all, though, just get it to work.

## Notes

The jQuery library is included for you if you'd like to use it, as well as the Materialize CSS library. You may not use any other JavaScript libraries.
